      <description>In the current paradigm, laboratories, especially clinical laboratories are designed to be data producers. When I say “clinical laboratory” I am referring to laboratories that have very limited reasearch functions. These type of laboratories typically provide services for hospitals, clinics or is a referrence lab for specialized testing. These laboratories churn out thousands of columns and millions of rows of structured data daily, yet most of it remains unused within the laboratory.</description>

      <description>Statistics is inherent in laboratory work since our primary product is data, yet so little emphasis is placed on it in medical technology schools. In this post we will cover basic statistical concepts that are widely used in the laboratory. We still first study probability distributions. In the process we will learn about measures of central tendency (i.e. mean, mode, median) and measures of dispersion (i.e. variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation).</description>

      <description>Hello and welcome to our site! My name is Adrian Bandolon. I have been a Medical Technologist for over 15 years . In that time I have earned a PhD in Marine Biology and more recently, a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science specializing in Data Science.
Currently, I manage a laboratory that provide services for a free-standing ED in South Texas. This blog will focus on statistics and data science applications in the laboratory and in my day-to-day.</description>
