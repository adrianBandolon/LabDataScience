      <description>I have been a Clinical Laboratory Scientist (or a Medical Technologist as they called us back in the day) for over 15 years . In that time I have earned a PhD in Marine Biology and more recently, a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science specializing in Data Science.
Currently, I manage a laboratory that provide services for a free-standing ED in South Texas. This blog will focus on statistics and data science applications in the laboratory and in my day-to-day.</description>
