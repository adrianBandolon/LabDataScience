      <description>In the current paradigm, laboratories, specially clinical laboratories are seen as data producers. When I say “clinical laboratory” I am referring to laboratories that have very limited reasearch functions. They typically provide services for hospitals, clinics or is a referrence lab for specialized testing. These laboratories churn out thousands of columns and millions of rows of structured data daily, yet most it remains unused.
We, as an industry and a profession are sitting on an untapped mine that we do not yet know how to dig.</description>
