      <description>Every now and again we have to perform method verification studies. Method verification is required when implementing new tests, when a new instrument is installed or if a method is changed. In rare cases, a verification study is also needed when changing collection tube manufacturer or tube additive.1
For method verification studies, help is usually provided by the test manufacturer. They will typically send a technician that will run all the samples, crunch all the data and provide a report.</description>
