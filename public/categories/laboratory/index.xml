      <description>In the current paradigm, laboratories, especially clinical laboratories are seen as data producers. When I say “clinical laboratory” I am referring to laboratories that have very limited reasearch functions. These type of laboratories typically provide services for hospitals, clinics or is a referrence lab for specialized testing. These laboratories churn out thousands of columns and millions of rows of structured data daily, yet most of it remains unused.
Clinical laboratories are sitting on an untapped mine that we 1 do not yet know how to dig.</description>
