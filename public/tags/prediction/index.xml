      <description>A COVID19 Global Forecasting competition has been launched in Kaggle. I would love to participate in the competition, but just do not have the time. My work at the hospital takes precedence. My aim for the time being is to describe the progression of COVID19 as it sweeps across the world. I still have much to learn about modelling epidemic/pandemic progression. An attempt at forecasting will follow later.</description>
