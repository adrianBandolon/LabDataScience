      <description>Every now and again we have to perform method verification studies. Method verification is required when implementing new tests, when a new instrument is installed or if a method is changed. In rare cases, a verification study is also needed when changing collection tube manufacturer or tube additive.1
For method verification studies, help is usually provided by the test manufacturer. They will typically send a technician that will run all the samples, crunch all the data and provide a report.</description>

      <description>Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions are used to compare two quantitative methods. They are used to compare a reference method to the new method. Depending on the qualities of the data, one of these two regression methods is used a part of a validation study.
Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions are variations of an ordinary-least-squares (OLS) linear regression. In this post we will discuss Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions. Before we get there however, we will first touch on OLS regression.</description>
