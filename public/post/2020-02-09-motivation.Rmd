In the current paradigm, laboratories, especially clinical laboratories are designed to be data producers. When I say *"clinical laboratory"* I am referring to laboratories that have very limited reasearch functions. These type of laboratories typically provide services for hospitals, clinics or is a referrence lab for specialized testing. These laboratories churn out thousands of columns and millions of rows of structured data daily, yet most of it remains unused within the laboratory. Data produced by labs are often consumed and interpreted outside the laboratory.

Clinical laboratories are sitting on an untapped mine that we ^[By **"we"** I mean laboratory professionals. Techniques are already available for mining information from laboratory information systems, they just are not as widely adopted in the lab as they are in other industries.] do not yet know how to dig. How do we start mining all this data? We can start by developing our literacy and fluency in statistical techniques.

My goal here is to share what I've learned on how to collect, interpret and interact with data. I also would like to share about the creative use of data to answer questions in our day-to-day. I will not delve into data science applications in the lab at the beginning. I want to tackle the more common instances in the lab where knowledge of statistics will be useful, maybe even required. 

As much as I'd like to sound altruistic, this site also serves as a repository for things I wonder about and possible solutions to problems I'd like to solve. This also serves as a place for me to go back to when I encounter a similar problem in the future. More importantly, I hope that by sharing what I know, I can learn from all of you. I practically live in Northern Mexico^[Not really, we are still about 2 hours from the Mexican border], and in my own world. I would really like to hear about elegant solutions and novel ideas from outside this tiny world of mine.

# Background

I have been a *Medical Technologist (MT)* ^[I think *MT*'s are called *Medical Laboratory Scientists (MLS)* now] for over 15 years. I currently manage a laboratory that provides services for a 12-bed free-standing ER. On average, the ER will see 70 patients in a 24-hour period. 

It wasn't until I was in graduate school that I became interested in statistics and programming. At that time, I was pursuing a PhD in marine biology at Texas A&M. Statistics was just a tool to describe the work I was doing as a marine biologist. After graduating I found myself spending more time learning statistics and programming in my free time. So much so that despite my lack of formal education in computer science, I was accepted into a Master's program for computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was here that I truly appreciated the power and elegance of using statistics in solving problems. Since then I have been looking for ways to incorporate data science thinking and techniques in the work that I do in the lab.

I'm currently lead a small lab. A recent recall from a major Point-of-Care (POCT) manufacturer lead to a scramble to validate replacement methods. My frustration with the software tools on hand and the limited online resources about how to process the data from these validations leads me to building this site.

# Tools

I will using **R** ([https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)), along with **RStudio** (a graphical interface for **R**) for most of my posts here. In fact, this whole site was built using an **R** package called [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and a static html generator called [`Hugo`](https://gohugo.io/). Every now and again I may use another programming language similar to **R**, called **Python**. These two languages are the most popularly used languages in data science.

**R** and **Python** offers lots of flexibility, but they have very steep learning curves. Getting over the learning curve is well worth the time and effort. In time I hope to be able to convince you of this.

I will talk more about **R** and **Python** on another post, and show you some examples of the possibilities. Until then, thank you for reading down this far. Keep in touch, comment down below and have a wonderful day!
