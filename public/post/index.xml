      <description>I currently manage a small laboratory and we recently had to conduct several method validations in a matter of weeks. It became apparent how dependent labs like mine, and even larger laboratories on the manufacturers when it came to method validations and data analytics. Statistics have fallen by the wayside, despite it being an integral part of the laboratory.
My goal here is to share what I’ve learned on how to collect, interpret and interact with data.</description>

      <description>Statistics is inherent in laboratory work since our primary product is data, yet so little emphasis is placed on it in medical technology schools. In this post we will cover basic statistical concepts that are widely used in the laboratory.
We will first study probability distributions. In the process we will learn about measures of central tendency (i.e. mean, mode, median) and measures of dispersion (i.e. variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variation).</description>

      <description>Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions are used to compare two quantitative methods. These two regression methods are typically used a part of a validation study. Typically, these are used to compare a reference method to the new method.
In this post we will discuss Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions. We will also touch on the difference between Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions and ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression.
We will be using the ggplot2 R library to generate plots.</description>
