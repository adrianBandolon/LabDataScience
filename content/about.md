I have been a *Medical Technologist* for over 15 years . In that time I have earned a PhD in Marine Biology and more recently, a Master's in Computer Science specializing in Data Science.

Currently, I manage a laboratory that provide services for a free-standing ED in South Texas. This blog will focus on statistics and data science applications in the laboratory and in my day-to-day. That is not to say that other parts of my life will not seep into here. I love photography, travel and food. I may occassionally share these parts of my life here to avoid the mundane. 

All pictures used here are my own, same as all opinions expressed here. I don't represent anyone else.

Feel free to have a look around, send me an [email](mailto:bandolonadrian@gmail.com) or follow me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/spyrokete/). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-bandolon/) and [Github](https://github.com/adrianBandolon). Admittedly, I am not as active on Github as I would like to be, but you can still catch me there every now and again.
