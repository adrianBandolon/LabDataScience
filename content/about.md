I have been a *Clinical Laboratory Scientist* (or a Medical Technologist as they called us back in the day) for over 15 years . In that time I have earned a PhD in Marine Biology and more recently, a Master's in Computer Science specializing in Data Science.

Currently, I manage a laboratory that provide services for a free-standing ED in South Texas. This blog will focus on statistics and data science applications in the laboratory and in my day-to-day.

I love photography, travel and food. I may let these parts of my life bleed into here occasionally to avoid the mundane. All pictures used here are my own, same as all opinions expressed here.

Feel free to have a look around, send me an [email](mailto:bandolonadrian@gmail.com) or follow me on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/spyrokete/). I am also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-bandolon/) and [Github](https://github.com/adrianBandolon). Admittedly, I am not as active on Github as I would like to be, but you can still catch me there ever now and again.
