**Deming** and **Passing-Bablok** regressions are used to compare two quantitative methods. These two regression methods are typically used a part of a validation study. Typically, these are used to compare a *reference* method to the *new* method.

In this post we will discuss Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions. We will also touch on the difference between Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions and **ordinary-least-squares (OLS)** regression.

We will be using the `ggplot2` R library to generate plots. We will use the `mcr` libary to perform Deming and Passing-Bablok regressions. A special library is not required for OLS since it is part of R's `base` package. `dplyr` and `kableExtra` are miscellaneous libraries that I use to manipulate data and for rendering tables.

## Data

Our data comes from a validation study I conducted recently. These are sodium results measured in mmol/L. There are 30 rows in this data set. Here is the first six rows:

```{r echo=FALSE}
# read in the data
dat <- data.frame(read.csv("data/demingPassingBablok/sodiumMethComp.csv"))
# display top 6 values
head(dat) %>% kable("html") %>% kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

Most method comparisons studies will have a limited number of samples, especially for analytes where high or abnormal results are hard to come by. Troponin-I and drug levels like Acetaminophen are examples of such analytes. Typically, 20-30 samples are used for method comparison depending on manufacturer recommendations.

## Ordinary-Least-Square Regression

**Ordinary-Least-Squares (OLS)** estimates the parameters in a regression model by minimizing the sum of the squared **residuals**. In an ordinary-least-squares regression, the residual of a point is its vertical distance from the regression line. The regression line is selected so that the sum of squares of the residual is minimized. OLS is explained [here](http://setosa.io/ev/ordinary-least-squares-regression/) interactively and in greater detail.

OLS assumes that the values in $x-$axis were measured without error and the variance of $y$ is constant (hemoscedastic). These two assumptions are met when performing a calibration or linearity verification where there is little error on the $x-$axis since the values are pre-defined. In method comparisons both measurements on the $x-$ and $y-$axis have error.

The residual of each point is the red segments in the figure below. The blue line is the linear regression line.
```{r echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', error=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
fit <- lm(new_method ~ ref_method, data = dat)

dat$predicted <- predict(fit)
dat$residuals <- residuals(fit)

p1 <- ggplot(dat, aes(x = ref_method, y = new_method)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",
              se = FALSE,
              color = c("#104E8B")) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = ref_method, yend = predicted),
               colour = c("#8B0000")) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             pch = 21,
             fill = c("grey50")) +
  labs(x = "Reference Method", y = "New Method") +
  theme_bw()
