<p>In the current paradigm, laboratories, specially clinical laboratories are seen as data producers. When I say <strong>“clinical laboratory”</strong> I am referring to laboratories that have very limited reasearch functions. They typically provide services for hospitals, clinics or is a referrence lab for specialized testing. These laboratories churn out thousands of columns and millions of rows of structured data daily, yet most it remains unused.</p>
<p>We, as an industry and a profession are sitting on an untapped mine that we do not yet know how to dig. How do we start mining all this data (sorry for the pun. Get it? Data mining)? We can start by developing our literacy and fluency in statistical techniques so we can make sense of the data we encounter in our personal and professional lives.</p>
<p>My goal here is to share what I’ve learned on how to collect, interpret and interact with data. I also would like to share about the creative use of data to answer questions in your day-to-day. More importantly, I hope that by sharing what I know, I can learn from all of you. I practically live in Northern Mexico (not really, about 2 hours from the Mexican border), and in my own world. I would really like to hear about elegant solutions and novel ideas from outside this tiny world of mine.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I have been a <em>Medical technologist (MT)</em>, or I think MT’s are now called <em>Medical Laboratory Scientist (MLS)</em> for over 15 years. I currently manage a laboratory that provides services for a 12-bed free-standing ER. On average, the ER will see 70 patients in a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>As with most labs, no matter the size, most data processing is done either through Microsoft Excel, EP Evaluator or some other third party provider. Of the options in the market, Excel provides the most control and portability, but requires the most work to setup. EP Evaluator and similar software are relatively easy to setup, but takes away control of the report format. The report looks decent, but it is not pretty. Afterall, there is a large <strong>EP Evaluator</strong> logo on top of every report, with an 8 font-size name of your facility below it.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been using <strong>R</strong> (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>), along with <strong>RStudio</strong> (a graphical interface for <strong>R</strong>) to generate various reports for my laboratory. I will be using <strong>R</strong> for most of the tutorials and posts I will make here. In fact, this whole site was built using an <strong>R</strong> package called <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a>.</p>
<p>There are many reasons to use <strong>R</strong>, but mostly because it is <strong>FREE!</strong> Every software used in a laboratory typically has to be vetted by the IT department and licenses are bought by the facility. For our purposes here, <strong>R</strong> is most practical. Aside from being free, reports produced in <strong>R</strong> (using another package called <code>rmarkdown</code>) are just better looking than reports from EP Evaluator or Excel. The typography on <code>rmarkdown</code> reports alone was enough for me to switch to <strong>R</strong>.</p>
<p>I will talk more about <strong>R</strong> on another post, and show you some examples of the possibilities. Until then, thank you for reading down this far. Keep in touch and have a wonderful day!</p>
