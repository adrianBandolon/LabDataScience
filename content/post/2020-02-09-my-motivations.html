<p>In the current paradigm, laboratories, especially clinical laboratories are seen as data producers. When I say <em>“clinical laboratory”</em> I am referring to laboratories that have very limited reasearch functions. These type of laboratories typically provide services for hospitals, clinics or is a referrence lab for specialized testing. These laboratories churn out thousands of columns and millions of rows of structured data daily, yet most of it remains unused.</p>
<p>Clinical laboratories are sitting on an untapped mine that we <a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> do not yet know how to dig. How do we start mining all this data? We can start by developing our literacy and fluency in statistical techniques.</p>
<p>My goal here is to share what I’ve learned on how to collect, interpret and interact with data. I also would like to share about the creative use of data to answer questions in your day-to-day. More importantly, I hope that by sharing what I know, I can learn from all of you. I practically live in Northern Mexico<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>, and in my own world. I would really like to hear about elegant solutions and novel ideas from outside this tiny world of mine.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I have been a <em>Medical Technologist (MT)</em> <a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> for over 15 years. I currently manage a laboratory that provides services for a 12-bed free-standing ER. On average, the ER will see 70 patients in a 24-hour period.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I was in graduate school that I became interested in statistics and programming. At that time, I was pursuing a PhD in marine biology at Texas A&amp;M. Statistics was just a tool to describe the work I was doing as a marine biologist. After I graduated I found myself spending more time learning statistics and programming in my free time. So much so that, despite my lack of formal education in computer science, I was accepted into a Master’s program for computer science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. It was here that I truly appreciated the power and elegance of programming and statistics. Since then I have been looking for ways to incorporate data science thinking and techniques in the work that I do in the lab.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years. I’m leading a lab with a handful of colleagues. A recall from a major Point-of-Care (POCT) manufacturer leads to a scramble to validate replacement methods. My frustration with the software tools on hand and the limited online resources about how to process the data from these validations leads me to building this site.</p>

<h1>Tools</h1>
<p>Recently, I have been using <strong>R</strong> (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">https://cran.r-project.org/</a>), along with <strong>RStudio</strong> (a graphical interface for <strong>R</strong>) to generate various reports for my laboratory. I will be using <strong>R</strong> for most of the tutorials and posts I will make here. In fact, this whole site was built using an <strong>R</strong> package called <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a>. Every now and again I may use another programming language similar to <strong>R</strong>, called <strong>Python</strong>. These two languages are the most popularly used languages in data science.</p>
<p>Quite possibly, the most common data analytics tool in most clinical labs is Microsoft Excel and EP Evaluator. Although these software packages serve their purpose well, the limitations they pose often frustrates me. On the other hand, <strong>R</strong> has more flexibility, but it has a very steep learning curve. Getting over the learning curve is well worth the time and effort. In time I hope to be able to convince of this.</p>
<p>I will talk more about <strong>R</strong> on another post, and show you some examples of the possibilities. Until then, thank you for reading down this far. Keep in touch and have a wonderful day!</p>
